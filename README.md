Publicly available functional models of sewings machine produced to explore the structures of solution principles and their role inthe betterment of designs.

Patents are organized by last name of patent holders, or in the "Single Patent Holders" folder, then by the specific patent named with the country of issue and patent number (e.g. US Patent 1,234). Within each patent folder is a PDF of the patent and either a functional model or note. The functional models are .drawio files which can be opened on drawio.com. Notes are included when a functional model of a patent was not created and provides justification for their exclusion.
