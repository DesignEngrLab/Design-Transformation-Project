The device described in the patent is made to increase the reliability of sewing machines. Even though this machine does have a significant improvement in getting rid of the tendency of needle thread either making a loop on the opposite side of where was intended and also for it to twist around the needle preventing a loop from being formed, neither of these have associated functions. Put simply, the new device does not have a functional difference, it only prevents something unintended from happening. Therefore, it can be seen that this is moreso a concept variant of an existing function and does not effect a functional model made of a machine if this improvement were implemented, therefore a functional model is not made here.
